Tree Visualization in C++ ðŸŒ³
Overview
This project is a C++ implementation for visualizing Binary Search Tree (BST), AVL Tree, and Heap Tree using the graphics.h library. It provides a graphical representation of tree structures, making it easier to understand their behavior and operations.

Features
âœ… Binary Search Tree (BST) â€“ Visualizes insertion, deletion, and searching.
âœ… AVL Tree â€“ Demonstrates self-balancing tree rotations.
âœ… Heap Tree â€“ Shows the structure of Heap tree

Technology Used
Programming Language: C++
Library Used: graphics.h
How to Run
Ensure you have graphics.h set up in your C++ environment.
Compile the program using a compatible compiler (e.g., Turbo C++, Dev-C++ with WinBGIm).
Run the executable to visualize the tree structures in action.
Conclusion
This project serves as an educational tool to understand and analyze tree structures visually, helping users grasp the concepts of BST, AVL, and Heap Trees effectively.
